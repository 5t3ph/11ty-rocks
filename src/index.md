**Eleventy (11ty)** is a simple but powerful static site generator that is capable of mixing template languages. Content can be written with Markdown or one of the other template languages. Or, dynamically create pages from local data or external sources that are compiled at build time. It has zero production JavaScript dependencies, so your site is _truly static_. This leads to phenomenal performance out of the box, as you can see from all the ðŸ’¯ [listed on Speedlify](https://www.11ty.dev/speedlify/).
