**Eleventy (11ty)** is a simple to use, powerful static site generator that is capable of mixing template languages. Content can be written with Markdown or one of the other _ten_ template languages. Or, dynamically create pages from local data or external sources that are compiled at build time. It has zero client-side JavaScript dependencies, so your site is _truly static_. This leads to phenomenal performance out of the box, as you can see from all the ðŸ’¯ [listed on Speedlify](https://www.11ty.dev/speedlify/).
