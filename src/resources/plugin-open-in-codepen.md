This plugin provides a filter that displays an estimated read time for Eleventy content, optionally with an emoji visual indicator.

The plugin offers config options to change or remove the emoji, update the word-per-minute, and alter the label. A simple string is returned, so the text formatting is up to you.

The default appearance displays one 🍿 per rounded 5 minutes of estimated reading time, ex: `🍿 7 min. read`
