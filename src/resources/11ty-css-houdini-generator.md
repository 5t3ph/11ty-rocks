[CSS Houdini worklets](https://houdini.how) require a server to run. While there are many ways to create an environment for developing and testing your worklet, as a static site generator, Eleventy provides a slim way to get setup and testing quickly so you can focus on creating your worklet!

You can preview the included worklet example [on this CodePen](https://codepen.io/5t3ph/pen/NWRpMbv).
