This plugin adds an Eleventy Nunjucks shortcode to provide the functionality of generating an image's object-position value in order to keep the focal point in view when setting CSS `aspect-ratio` and `object-fit: cover`.

[Test drive the results](https://objectfit-focalpoint.netlify.app/) by using the utility app.
