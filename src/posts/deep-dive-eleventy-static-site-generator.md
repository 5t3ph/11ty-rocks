> [Eleventy (aka 11ty)](https://11ty.dev) is rising in the ranks among static site generators. This Node-based builder is attractive due to its zero-config starting point, purely static output, and ease of achieving the coveted top Lighthouse performance score of four perfect 100s.

In my article on Smashing Magazine, I've written about things that I would have found helpful to understand when I was getting started with Eleventy. It covers:
