The following snippet uses Nunjucks and could be added directly in a layout, or created as a layout partial - ex: `nav.njk`.

First, we set the variable of `currentUrl` to contain the current page URL, and if it matches the the nav item's URL, we add the appropriate aria to identify it as the current page.

In this example we are looping through the `pages` collection, which you may need to adjust to match your desired navigation content.

```js
{%raw%}
{% set currentUrl %}{{ page.url }}{% endset %}

<nav>
  <ul role="list">
    <li>
      <a {% if currentUrl === '/' %}aria-current="page"{% endif %} href="/">Home</a>
    </li>

    {% for page in collections.pages %}
    <li>
      <a
        {% if currentUrl === page.url %}aria-current="page"{% endif %}
        href="{{ page.url }}">
          {{ page.data.title }}
      </a>
    </li>
    {%- endfor %}
  </ul>
</nav>
{%endraw%}
```

**Bonus tip**: Attach styles to the current item by using the CSS selector `[aria-current="page"]` to for example bold the current item, or change its color.
