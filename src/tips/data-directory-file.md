## Create a Data Directory File

To create a data directory file, add a `json` file within your directory with the same name as the directory.

For example, within `/posts/` create `posts.json`.

## Assign Tags and Layout

Most often, I use data directory files to quickly create collections via `tags` and also to assign all the directory content to a layout.

```json
{
  "tags": "posts",
  "layout": "post"
}
```

> If needed, you can still override these values within the front matter of individual files.

## Change Permalink Structure

Another very handy feature is the ability to change the `permalink` structure for all content within directory.

Here's one example of assigning content to live off the root instead of retaining the directory as a prefix:

```json
{
  "permalink": "/{%raw%}{{ {{ page.fileSlug }} }}{%endraw%}"
}
```
