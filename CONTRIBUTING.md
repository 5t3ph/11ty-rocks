# Community Resources Contribution

Contributions are open for adding links to the [Community Resources](https://11ty.rocks/community/) index.

**To be accepted**, resources must:

- be an original work
- address a unique 11ty topic
- helpful to the 11ty community at large
- not overtly promotional or spammy

A _resource_ may be an article, tutorial, or video.

## To Contribute

You may submit more than one resource at a time.
